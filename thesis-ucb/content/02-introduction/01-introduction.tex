\chapter{Introduction} \label{chap_intro}

This is a PhD thesis template, which satisfied all of the UC Berkeley requirements in Summer 2022.
The majority of the style formatting can be found in \texttt{thesis-ucb.sty}; some parts of the front matter styling are located in the main \TeX\ file: \texttt{thesis-ucb.tex}.
Make sure you change the \texttt{pdfauthor}, \texttt{pdftitle}, and \texttt{pdfsubject} in the style file.
If you desire, you can split your thesis into ``parts'' with the \verb+\part{}+ command.
