I like to begin thesis chapters with a quote.
Note that if you use the \verb+\footcite{}+ command, then the citation will appear as a footnote, and will also be reported \textit{at the end of each chapter.}
For this reason, the file \verb+bib.tex+ should be included after every chapter in the file \verb+thesis-ucb.tex+ with the command \verb+\input{content/common/bib}+.
You can also use the \verb+\footnote{}+ command, and then the \verb+\cite{}+ command within the footnote, as in the following example which produces the footnote below:%
\footnote{Consider the scaling analysis by \cite{sahu-mandadapu-pre-2020}.}
\\[8pt]
\verb+\footnote{Consider the scaling analysis by \cite{sahu-mandadapu-pre-2020}.}+
\\[8pt]
Note that you can include arXiv links in your citations!
The bibliography is compiled by running the command \verb+biber thesis-ucb.bcf+ in the command line.

% *** The equation environment

\section{The equation environment} \label{sec_equation_environment}

Some custom commands are provided in the \verb+content/common/custom-commands.tex+ file.
The following equation was obtained by writing
\verb+\bmnabla \bmcdot \bmv \, = \, 0 ~.+
\begin{equation}
	\bmnabla \bmcdot \bmv
	\, = \, 0
	~.
\end{equation}
In general, I recommend adding additional spaces in math mode, to create a more aesthetic result.
The command \verb+\+ creates a large space, the command \verb+\,+ creates a medium space, and the custom command \verb+\mke+ (equivalently \verb+\mkern1mu+) makes a small space.
Additionally, the command \verb+~+ creates a very large space.

% *** The additional environments
%

\section{The additional environments} \label{sec_additional_environments}

Here, we show two additional features.  
You can construct an `Example' environment (currently, this can handle page breaks, but does not maintain nice spacing):

\begin{example}[An Example Environment]
	Consider an example, which you would like to present to the reader.
	I like the following equation:
	\begin{equation*}
		\mathrm{e}^{i \pi}
		\, + \, 1
		\, = \, 0
		~.
	\end{equation*}
\end{example}


\noindent Also, you can display algorithms as follows:

\begin{lstlisting}[caption={\texttt{C++} pseudocode of an algorithm}]
 // mesh and basis function calculations
 generate_mesh(); generate_basis_functions();

 for (time_index = 0; time_index < num_time_steps; ++time_index) {

	initialize_u_vector(); initialize_delta_u();

	while (norm(delta_u) > newton_tolerance) {
		// initialize global residual vector and stiffness matrix
		initialize_r_vector(); initialize_K_matrix();

		assemble_K_matrix();
		assemble_r_vector();

		// apply boundary conditions
		apply_boundary_conditions(K_matrix, r_vector);

		solve_delta_u(delta_u, K_matrix, r_vector);
		u_vector += delta_u;
	}

	output_u_vector();
 }
\end{lstlisting}

\noindent Both the example and algorithm environments can be modified in the \texttt{thesis-ucb.sty} file.
