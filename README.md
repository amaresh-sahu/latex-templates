# Latex Templates
Latex templates for a variety of different documents. Current files include templates for
- problem sets
- one-column papers


Coming soon are templates for
- two-column papers
- resumes
- CVs


Eventually, I will include examples of how I use Latex outside of documents. This includes
- slideshows (the equivalent of PowerPoint presentations, but all in Latex)
- figures
- posters
